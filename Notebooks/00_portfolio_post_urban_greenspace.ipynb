    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will focus on Denver CO, I will use health outcome data from the \n",
    "CDC, specifically % depression prevalence (using the wayback machine to acces the \n",
    "data that was taken down) as well as satellite based **multispectral** data for the \n",
    "City and County of Denver. This is to help answer the question of if vegetation related \n",
    "factors can predict % of depression prevalence by census tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denver, CO was chosen as the site of choice because I hope to use Denver as the site \n",
    "for the final project and choosing Denver will help me get practice in and orient myslef \n",
    "to the spectral data needed and if it's something I can use or take pieces of for my final \n",
    "project. Additionally, I chose Phildelphia for the previous urban greenspace project in the \n",
    "previous course and wanted to choose a different city. I am most familiar with Denver and \n",
    "can use my existing knowledge of the city to guide any research and analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The health outcome factor of % depression prevalence was chosen because I have read\n",
    "articles previously on the effect that greenspace has on mental health in urban planning \n",
    "and I was curious on if a predictive model like OLS regression and computing error would \n",
    "show a predictive relationship between the two (Reklaitiene et al. 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Denver, like many other cities, has uneven access to urban green space that\n",
    "is rooted in racial discrimination and other injustices (Rigolon and Németh 2018). \n",
    "Redlining that took place in the 'New Deal Era' has had lasting effects on the distribution \n",
    "of urban greenspace (Chen, Chavez-Norgaard, and University of Richmond 2025). One of these \n",
    "lasting effects is the 'inverted L' that will be disucessed further in the 'Site Desctiption' \n",
    "section below, but in short the inverted L examplfies a geographic divde in Denver specifically, \n",
    "that is tied to racial and socioeconomic factors (Sachs 2018). This context for the distribution \n",
    "of urban greenspaces in Denver will aid in conclusions of the predictive model (if vegetation \n",
    "related factors can predict % of depression prevalence by census tract).\n",

    "Knowing the orientation of Denver and short context for how and why it is oreinted the way \n",

    "This will be using the variables of % of depression prevalence and \n",

    "linearity - assuming there is a linear relationship between the two variables, \n",
    "normally distributed error - data shouldn't have long tails, \n",
    "independence - avoid co-linearity of tightly correlated variables, \n",

    "For this project independence and stationairity are not of major concern, but \n",
    "there are no data values, the data has tails, and the two variables do have \n",

    "there may not be a linear relationship and so the results may be quite muddy or \n",
