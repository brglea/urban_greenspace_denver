    "OLS Regression will be used as the model to find out if there is a \n",
    "statistically significant relationship between depression and greenspace.\n",
    "This will be using the variables of % of depression prevalence and \n",
    "vegeation related variables. Models can be used for different purposes \n",
    "in earth data science, one of which is prediction. Here, the goal is to see \n",
    "if the model can predict the depression prevalence accurately. In order to \n",
    "evaluate the model, calculated error could be looked at or calculate \n",
    "R squared which would say what percent of variation in depression prevalence \n",
    "can be explained by the model. However, when choosing a model it is important \n",
    "to take into account assumptions about the data and if the model is appropriate \n",
    "given the data. Some important assumptions about OLS regression are: \n",
    "linearity - assuming there is a linear relationship between the two variables, \n",
    "normally distributed error - data shouldn't have long tails, \n",
    "independence - avoid co-linearity of tightly correlated variables, \n",
    "stationarity - parameters of the model should not vary over time, \n",
    "and complete observations - shouldn't have large amounts of no data \n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be manipulated or adjusted to be a better fit. For example:\n",
    "* no data values can be dropped to account for complete observations using .dropna()\n",
    "* log of variables can be taken to make the data more normally distributed and \n",
    "not have long tails using np.log.\n",
    "* normalization/standardization of data to account for the different scales \n",
    "of the variables\n",
    "* Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project independence and stationairity are not of major concern, but \n",
    "there are no data values, the data has tails, and the two variables do have \n",
    "very different scales, so the data needs to have the fixes done to fit the model.\n",
    "There is a delicate balance of fitting versus overfitting.\n",
    "Potential issues with choosing this model are using the variables given, \n",
    "there may not be a linear relationship and so the results may be quite muddy or \n",
    "not relay that there is a relationship between the variables. Another potential \n",
    "issue is overfitting the model - this would mean making so many or enough \n",
    "adjustments to the data to 'fit it' and it results in the model fitting to \n",
    "the noise having very low error and not much can be relayed of a possible \n",
